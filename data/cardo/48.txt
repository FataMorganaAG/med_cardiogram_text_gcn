The depolarization and repolarization portions on the normal ECG.
Interpretation of the ECG.
Determination of the Cardiac Rhythm Regularity.
The R-R intervals in regular rhythm should be equal.
Its fluctuation normally does not exceed 0.1 second.
Greater variations in the R-R intervals duration indicate irregular cardiac rhythm.
Calculation of the Heart Rate.
In regular cardiac rhythm the heart rate is determined by formula: HR = 60/R-R; where 60 is a number of seconds in minute, R-R – duration of the R-R intervals in seconds.
Measurement of the ECG Amplitude.
The R waves amplitude are measured in standard leads.
If the amplitude of the highest R wave does not exceed 5 mm, or the sum of the R waves amplitude in the three standard leads is less than 15 mm the ECG voltage is considered decreased.
Determination of the Cardiac Rhythm Pacemaker Site.
The normal sinus rhythm is characterized by upright P wave in lead I, II, aVF following by QRS complex.
The P waves configuration is equal in each lead.
Estimation of the Conductivity.
The P wave duration indicates time of atria activation, the P – Q interval and the QRS complex duration – ventricular activation.
Increased duration of these waves and intervals indicates slowed impulse conduction in corresponding part of the cardiac conduction system.
Determination of the Electrical Axis of the Heart.
Measurement of the duration and amplitude of the ECG waves and intervals.
ECG conclusion.
In the ECG conclusion it is necessary to note following: The cardiac rhythm pacemaker (sinus or nonsinus rhythm); Regularity of the cardiac rhythm (regular or irregular); The heart rate; Position of the electrical axis of the heart;  Presence of the four ECG syndromes: arrhythmias, abnormalities of conductivity, atrial and ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial damage (ischemia, injury, necrosis, scar).
