Precordial leads
The precordial leads lie in the transverse (horizontal) plane, perpendicular to the other six leads
The six precordial electrodes act as the positive poles for the six corresponding precordial leads: (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6)
Wilson's central terminal is used as the negative pole
Recently, unipolar precordial leads have been used to create bipolar precordial leads that explore the right to left axis in the horizontal plane
