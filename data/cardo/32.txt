Basic ECG Principles
Einthoven Triangle
The Einthoven equilateral triangle concept supposes that the left arm, right arm, and left leg form the apexes of an equilateral triangle, while the heart, an electrical point, is assumed to be the center of the triangle
At any given moment of the cardiac cycle, the electromotive forces generated by the heart may be projected to the sides of the triangle
The sides of the triangle are the analogous to the three standard limb leads and are called lead axes
