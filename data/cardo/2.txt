Medical uses.
The overall goal of performing an ECG is to obtain information about the electrical function of the heart.
Medical uses for this information are varied and often need to be combined with knowledge of the structure of the heart and physical examination signs to be interpreted.
Some indications for performing an ECG include the following: Chest pain or suspected myocardial infarction (heart attack), such as ST elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
Symptoms such as shortness of breath, murmurs, fainting, seizures, funny turns, or arrhythmias including new onset palpitations or monitoring of known cardiac arrhythmias.
Medication monitoring (e.g., drug-induced QT prolongation, Digoxin toxicity) and management of overdose (e.g., tricyclic overdose).
Electrolyte abnormalities, such as hyperkalemia.
Perioperative monitoring in which any form of anesthesia is involved (e.g., monitored anesthesia care, general anesthesia).
This includes preoperative assessment and intraoperative and postoperative monitoring.
Cardiac stress testing.
Computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the heart (ECG is used to "gate" the scanning so that the anatomical position of the heart is steady).
Clinical cardiac electrophysiology, in which a catheter is inserted through the femoral vein and can have several electrodes along its length to record the direction of electrical activity from within the heart.
ECGs can be recorded as short intermittent tracings or continuous ECG monitoring.
Continuous monitoring is used for critically ill patients, patients undergoing general anesthesia, and patients who have an infrequently occurring cardiac arrhythmia that would unlikely be seen on a conventional ten-second ECG.
Continuous monitoring can be conducted by using Holter monitors, internal and external defibrillators and pacemakers, and/or biotelemetry.
