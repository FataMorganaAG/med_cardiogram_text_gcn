Ischemia and infarction
Ischemia or non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions (non-STEMIs) may manifest as ST depression or inversion of T waves
It may also affect the high frequency band of the QRS
ST elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) have different characteristic ECG findings based on the amount of time elapsed since the MI first occurred
The earliest sign is hyperacute T waves, peaked T waves due to local hyperkalemia in ischemic myocardium
This then progresses over a period of minutes to elevations of the ST segment by at least 1 mm
Over a period of hours, a pathologic Q wave may appear and the T wave will invert
Over a period of days the ST elevation will resolve
Pathologic Q waves generally will remain permanently
The coronary artery that has been occluded can be identified in an STEMI based on the location of ST elevation
The left anterior descending (LAD) artery supplies the anterior wall of the heart, and therefore causes ST elevations in anterior leads (V1 and V2)
The LCx supplies the lateral aspect of the heart and therefore causes ST elevations in lateral leads (I, aVL and V6)
The right coronary artery (RCA) usually supplies the inferior aspect of the heart, and therefore causes ST elevations in inferior leads (II, III and aVF)
