Operating principle
Fluctuations in the potential difference that arise during the exitation of the heart muscle are senced by the electrodes attached to the patient’s body and transmitted to the apparatus
The input voltage is extremely low, and it is therefore amplified 600 – 700 times
Since the magnitude and direction of the electromotive force incessantly change during the cardiac cycle, the galvanometer pointer shows variations in the voltage a recording device draws a curve on a moving paper to show graphically these fluctuations
The recording principle differs with various instruments
Electrocardiographs are popular in which the fluctuations are recorded on a moving paper during the measurement
These are ink-writing instruments, which draw curves on paper
There are electrocardiographs in which special heart-sensitive paper is used
Dark paper is coated with heart- sensitive layers of paraffin and chalk; a hot stylus, which removes paraffin from the colored supporting paper, does the record
Whichever instrument is used, the sensitivity of the galvanometer is so selected that the voltage of 1 mV causes 1-cm deviation of the recording device
The sensitivity and amplification of the apparatus should be checked before recording electrocardiograms
To that end, a standardization voltage of 1 mV should be used, and this caused a 1-cm deviation of the stylus
The tape may move at various speeds, from 25 to 100 mm/s, but the speed of 50 mm/s is usually preferred
Once the speed of the tape is known, it is easy to calculate the duration of the separate elements of the ECG
Waves amplitude is measured in mm, duration – in seconds
