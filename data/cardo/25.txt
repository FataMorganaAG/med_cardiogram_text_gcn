History
In 1872, Alexander Muirhead is reported to have attached wires to the wrist of a patient with fever to obtain an electronic record of their heartbeat
In 1882, John Burdon-Sanderson working with frogs, was the first to appreciate that the interval between variations in potential was not electrically quiescent and coined the term "isoelectric interval" for this period
In 1887, Augustus Waller invented an ECG machine consisting of a Lippmann capillary electrometer fixed to a projector
The trace from the heartbeat was projected onto a photographic plate that was itself fixed to a toy train
This allowed a heartbeat to be recorded in real time
In 1895, Willem Einthoven assigned the letters P, Q, R, S, and T to the deflections in the theoretical waveform he created using equations which corrected the actual waveform obtained by the capillary electrometer to compensate for the imprecision of that instrument
Using letters different from A, B, C, and D (the letters used for the capillary electrometer's waveform) facilitated comparison when the uncorrected and corrected lines were drawn on the same graph
Einthoven probably chose the initial letter P to follow the example set by Descartes in geometry
When a more precise waveform was obtained using the string galvanometer, which matched the corrected capillary electrometer waveform, he continued to use the letters P, Q, R, S, and T,and these letters are still in use today
Einthoven also described the electrocardiographic features of a number of cardiovascular disorders
In 1897, the string galvanometer was invented by the French engineer Cl√©ment Ader
In 1901, Einthoven, working in Leiden, the Netherlands, used the string galvanometer: the first practical ECG
This device was much more sensitive than the capillary electrometer Waller used
In 1924, Einthoven was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his pioneering work in developing the ECG
By 1927, General Electric had developed a portable apparatus that could produce electrocardiograms without the use of the string galvanometer
This device instead combined amplifier tubes similar to those used in a radio with an internal lamp and a moving mirror that directed the tracing of the electric pulses onto film
In 1937, Taro Takemi invented a new portable electrocardiograph machine
In 1942, Emanuel Goldberger increases the voltage of Wilson's unipolar leads by 50% and creates the augmented limb leads aVR, aVL and aVF
When added to Einthoven's three limb leads and the six chest leads we arrive at the 12-lead electrocardiogram that is used today
In the late 1940s Rune Elmqvist invented an inkjet printer - thin jets of ink deflected by electrical potentials from the heart, with good frequency response and direct recording of ECG on paper - the device, called the Mingograf, was sold by Siemens Elema until the 1990s
