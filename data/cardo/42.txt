S wave
S wave formation on the ECG reflects depolarization of the basal parts of interventricular septum of right and left ventricles
The normal S wave is inverted, its amplitude in the different electrocardiographic lead is within the large ranges, not exceed 20 mm (2.5 mm on the average)
In the limb lids S wave amplitude is low, except aVR lead, in the normal position of the heart in the chest
In the chest leads S wave amplitude decreases from V1, V2 to V4, and in V5, V6 leads S wave amplitude is very low or S wave may be even absent
Equal S wave and R wave amplitude in the chest leads are usually in the V3 (“transition zone”) or (rarer) between V2 and V3 or V3 and V4
