Specialized leads
Additional electrodes may rarely be placed to generate other leads for specific diagnostic purposes
Right-sided precordial leads may be used to better study pathology of the right ventricle or for dextrocardia (and are denoted with an R (e.g., V5R)
Posterior leads (V7 to V9) may be used to demonstrate the presence of a posterior myocardial infarction
A Lewis lead (requiring an electrode at the right sternal border in the second intercostal space) can be used to study pathological rhythms arising in the right atrium
An esophogeal lead can be inserted to a part of the esophagus where the distance to the posterior wall of the left atrium is only approximately 5â€“6 mm (remaining constant in people of different age and weight)
An esophageal lead avails for a more accurate differentiation between certain cardiac arrhythmias, particularly atrial flutter, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia and orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia
It can also evaluate the risk in people with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, as well as terminate supraventricular tachycardia caused by re-entry
An intracardiac electrogram (ICEG) is essentially an ECG with some added intracardiac leads (that is, inside the heart)
The standard ECG leads (external leads) are I, II, III, aVL, V1, and V6
Two to four intracardiac leads are added via cardiac catheterization
The word "electrogram" (EGM) without further specification usually means an intracardiac electrogram
