Interpretation of the ECG is fundamentally about understanding the electrical conduction system of the heart
Normal conduction starts and propagates in a predictable pattern, and deviation from this pattern can be a normal variation or be pathological
An ECG does not equate with mechanical pumping activity of the heart, for example, pulseless electrical activity produces an ECG that should pump blood but no pulses are felt (and constitutes a medical emergency and CPR should be performed)
Ventricular fibrillation produces an ECG but is too dysfunctional to produce a life-sustaining cardiac output
Certain rhythms are known to have good cardiac output and some are known to have bad cardiac output
Ultimately, an echocardiogram or other anatomical imaging modality is useful in assessing the mechanical function of the heart
Like all medical tests, what constitutes "normal" is based on population studies
The heartrate range of between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm) is considered normal since data shows this to be the usual resting heart rate
