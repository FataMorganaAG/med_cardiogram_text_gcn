The Electrical Axis of the Heart
The electrical axis of the heart coincides with its anatomical axis, and lies through the interventricular septum
Einthoven’s triangle and hexaxial reference system are useful for determining the electrical axis of the heart
The basic principle is that an electrical force parallel to a given lead axis will record its largest deflection in that ECG lead; an electrical force perpendicular to a lead axis will record a small complex in that ECG lead
If the cardiac vector is directed toward the positive pole of lead axis the deflections are positive in a given lead; if the cardiac vector is directed toward the negative pole of lead axis the deflections are negative in a given lead
The electrical axis of the heart is determined by the shape of ventricular complexes in standard leads
The relation between the electrical axis and the magnitude of the QRS complexes in standard leads is described by Einthoven triangle
The magnitude and direction of the electromotive force are designated by the A – B arrow
If vertical lines are drawn from the ends of this arrow to the sides of the triangle, the difference of potentials recorded in each lead can be obtained
In the normal position of the heart the direction of electrical axis is downward and leftward, therefore the highest R wave will be recorded in the lead II, the lowest – in the lead III
Values of R wave amplitude in normal position of the electrical axis can be shown as follows: RII > RI > RIII, or it can be calculated that amplitude of the R wave in lead II is equal to the algebraic sum of R in leads I and III: RII = RI + RIII
