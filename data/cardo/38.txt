Normal position of the heart electrical axis
The direction of electrical axis of the heart changes depends on the position of the heart in the thoracic cage
In high diaphragm level (hypersthenic persons) the heart assumes horizontal position (so-called “lying heart”), and electrical axis of the heart deviates to the left or horizontal become more parallel to the lead I
Horizontal position of the heart electrical axis
Therefore, the highest R wave in horizontal position of tht heart is recorded in the lead I: RI > RII > RIII
In low diaphragm level (asthenic subjects) the position of the heart is vertical (so-called “drop heart”), and electrical axis of the heart deviates to the right or vertical, that is, more parallel to the lead III
Vertical position of the heart electrical axis
The highest R wave is therefore recorded in lead III: RIII > RII > RI
