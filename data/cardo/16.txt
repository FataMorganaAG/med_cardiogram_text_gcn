Background grid.
ECGs are normally printed on a grid.
The horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents voltage.
The standard values on this grid are shown in the adjacent image: A small box is 1 mm × 1 mm and represents 0.1 mV × 0.04 seconds, A large box is 5 mm × 5 mm and represents 0.5 mV × 0.20 seconds.
The "large" box is represented by a heavier line weight than the small boxes.
