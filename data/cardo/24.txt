Diagnosis
Numerous diagnoses and findings can be made based upon electrocardiography, and many are discussed above
Overall, the diagnoses are made based on the patterns
For example, an "irregularly irregular" QRS complex without P waves is the hallmark of atrial fibrillation; however, other findings can be present as well, such as a bundle branch block that alters the shape of the QRS complexes
ECGs can be interpreted in isolation but should be applied – like all diagnostic tests – in the context of the patient
For example, an observation of peaked T waves is not sufficient to diagnose hyperkalemia; such a diagnosis should be verified by measuring the blood potassium level
Conversely, a discovery of hyperkalemia should be followed by an ECG for manifestations such as peaked T waves, widened QRS complexes, and loss of P waves
The following is an organized list of possible ECG-based diagnoses
Rhythm disturbances or arrhythmias: Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter without rapid ventricular response, Premature atrial contraction (PACs) and premature ventricular contraction (PVCs), Sinus arrhythmia,  Sinus bradycardia and sinus tachycardia, Sinus pause and sinoatrial arrest, Sinus node dysfunction and bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, Supraventricular tachycardia, Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, Junctional ectopic tachycardia, Atrial tachycardia, Ectopic atrial tachycardia (unicentric), Multifocal atrial tachycardia, Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, Sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia, Torsades de pointes (polymorphic ventricular tachycardia), Wide complex tachycardia, Ventricular flutter, Ventricular fibrillation, Ventricular tachycardia (monomorphic ventricular tachycardia), Pre-excitation syndrome, Lown–Ganong–Levine syndrome,Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, J wave (Osborn wave)
Heart block and conduction problems: Aberration, Sinoatrial block: first, second, and third-degree, AV node, First-degree AV block, Second-degree AV block (Mobitz [Wenckebach] I and II), Third-degree AV block or complete AV block, Right bundle, Incomplete right bundle branch block, Complete right bundle branch block (RBBB), Left bundle, Complete left bundle branch block (LBBB), Incomplete left bundle branch block,  Left anterior fascicular block (LAFB), Left posterior fascicular block (LPFB), Bifascicular block (LAFB plus LPFB), Trifascicular block (LAFP plus FPFB plus RBBB), QT syndromes, Brugada syndrome, Short QT syndrome, Long QT syndromes, genetic and drug-induced, Right and left atrial abnormality
