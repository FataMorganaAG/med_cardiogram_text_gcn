Electrical activation of the heart is initiated by the SA node; however, this does not cause an electrical deflection on the surface ECG
P wave is always inverted in the aVR lead
P wave may be upright, two-phased in III, aVL, V1 leads, and sometimes even inverted in the III and aVL leads
The normal P wave formation
The normal P wave is upright in the I, II, aVF, V2 – V6 leads
The P wave is the first upward deflection and is the graphic representation of the electrical activation of the atria
As impulse at first cause excitation of the right atrium and than the left atrium, the ascending portion of P wave reflects depolarization of the right atrium, and descending portion reflects depolarization of the left atrium
The normal P wave duration is 0.8 – 0.10 second, amplitude - 1-2 mm
Normal electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm
