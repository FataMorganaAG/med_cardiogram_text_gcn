Electrical systole and diastole on the normal ECG
Repolarization is an electrochemical phenomenon of energy restoration that occurs more slowly
Therefore, QRS complex (ventricular depolarization) is of short duration, but the T wave (ventricular repolarization) is of long duration
In each cardiac cycle there are two electrical processes: depolarization and repolarization
Depolarization is an electrochemical phenomenon that occurs rapidly
