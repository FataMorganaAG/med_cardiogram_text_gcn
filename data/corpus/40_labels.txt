P – Q (or R) interval
P – Q (or R) interval measured from the beginning of the P wave to the onset of the Q (or R) wave includes activation in atria, the AV node, the His’ bundle, bundle branches, and the Purkinje network
Q wave may be deep and wide in the aVR lead, or even QS complex may register
Q wave represents depolarization of the interventricular septum
The normal P – Q duration is 0.12 – 0.2 second
The P – Q segment, measured from the end of the P wave to the onset of the Q wave, represents mostly the delay in activation as the impulse passes through the AV node and His’ bundle
Ventricular complex QRST
The P – Q segment and P – Q interval
The normal Q wave amplitude in all leads except aVR is not more than 1⁄4 of the R wave amplitude, and its duration is 0.03 seconds
The normal Q wave is inverted in I, II, III, aVL, aVF, V4 – V6 leads
