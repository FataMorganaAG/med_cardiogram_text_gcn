electrocardiograph machines
electrocardiograms recorded machines consist set electrodes connected central unit
early ecg machines constructed analog electronics signal drove motor print signal onto paper
today electrocardiographs use analog digital converters convert electrical activity heart digital signal
many ecg machines portable commonly include screen keyboard printer small wheeled cart
recent advancements electrocardiography include developing even smaller devices inclusion fitness trackers smart watches
smaller devices often rely two electrodes deliver single lead
portable six lead devices also available
recording ecg safe painless procedure
machines powered mains power designed several safety features including earthed ground lead
features include defibrillation protection ecg used healthcare may attached person requires defibrillation ecg needs protect source energy
electrostatic discharge similar defibrillation discharge requires voltage protection 18 000 volts
additionally circuitry called right leg driver used reduce common mode interference typically 50 60 hz mains power
ecg voltages measured across body small
low voltage necessitates low noise circuit instrumentation amplifiers electromagnetic shielding
simultaneous lead recordings earlier designs recorded lead sequentially current models record multiple leads simultaneously
modern ecg machines include automated interpretation algorithms
analysis calculates features pr interval qt interval corrected qt qtc interval pr axis qrs axis rhythm
results automated algorithms considered preliminary verified modified expert interpretation
despite recent advances computer misinterpretation remains significant problem result clinical mismanagement
