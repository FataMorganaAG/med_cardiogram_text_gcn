ecg equate mechanical pumping activity heart example pulseless electrical activity produces ecg pump blood pulses felt constitutes medical emergency cpr performed
normal conduction starts propagates predictable pattern deviation pattern normal variation pathological
ventricular fibrillation produces ecg dysfunctional produce life sustaining cardiac output
interpretation ecg fundamentally understanding electrical conduction system heart
ultimately echocardiogram anatomical imaging modality useful assessing mechanical function heart
like medical tests constitutes normal based population studies
heartrate range 60 100 beats per minute bpm considered normal since data shows usual resting heart rate
certain rhythms known good cardiac output known bad cardiac output
