medical uses
overall goal performing ecg obtain information electrical function heart
medical uses information varied often need combined knowledge structure heart physical examination signs interpreted
indications performing ecg include following chest pain suspected myocardial infarction heart attack st elevated myocardial infarction stemi non st elevated myocardial infarction nstemi
symptoms shortness breath murmurs fainting seizures funny turns arrhythmias including new onset palpitations monitoring known cardiac arrhythmias
medication monitoring e g drug induced qt prolongation digoxin toxicity management overdose e g tricyclic overdose
electrolyte abnormalities hyperkalemia
perioperative monitoring form anesthesia involved e g monitored anesthesia care general anesthesia
includes preoperative assessment intraoperative postoperative monitoring
cardiac stress testing
computed tomography angiography cta magnetic resonance angiography mra heart ecg used gate scanning anatomical position heart steady
clinical cardiac electrophysiology catheter inserted femoral vein several electrodes along length record direction electrical activity within heart
ecgs recorded short intermittent tracings continuous ecg monitoring
continuous monitoring used critically ill patients patients undergoing general anesthesia patients infrequently occurring cardiac arrhythmia would unlikely seen conventional ten second ecg
continuous monitoring conducted using holter monitors internal external defibrillators pacemakers biotelemetry
