The positions of the chest leads selected are ): V1: fourth intercostal space, right sternal border, V2: fourth intercostal space, left sternal border, V3: midway between V2 and V4 on a line jointing these two points V4: interspace in which apex is located (fifth or sixth); midclavicular line, V5: anterior left axillary line; on the same level with V4, V6: left midaxillary line; on the same level with V4 and V5
Unipolar Chest Leads
Wilson proposed unipolar chest leads in 1934 year, are designated by the single capital letter V followed by a subscript numeral that represents the location of the active electrode on the precordium
Electrode placement in the augmented leads technique
In the 1938 the American and British Heart Associations appointed committees to standardize the nomenclature of precordial leads
The negative Wilson electrode is formed by connection of right arm, left arm, left leg electrodes
