example determining tracing sinus rhythm requires feature recognition matching measurement amplitudes times e scale grids irrelevant
aspects ecg rely precise recordings known scaling amplitude time
measuring time voltage ecg graph paper
example contrary voltage requirements left ventricular hypertrophy require knowing grid scale
