schematic representation normal ecg
interpretation ecg ultimately pattern recognition
order understand patterns found helpful understand theory ecgs represent
theory rooted electromagnetics boils four following points depolarization heart towards positive electrode produces positive deflection depolarization heart away positive electrode produces negative deflection repolarization heart towards positive electrode produces negative deflection repolarization heart away positive electrode produces positive deflection
thus overall direction depolarization repolarization produces positive negative deflection lead 's trace
example depolarizing right left would produce positive deflection lead two vectors point direction
contrast depolarization would produce minimal deflection v1 v2 vectors perpendicular phenomenon called isoelectric
normal rhythm produces four entities p wave qrs complex wave u wave fairly unique pattern
p wave represents atrial depolarization
qrs complex represents ventricular depolarization
wave represents ventricular repolarization
u wave represents papillary muscle repolarization
changes structure heart surroundings including blood composition change patterns four entities
u wave typically seen absence generally ignored
atrial repolarisation typically hidden much prominent qrs complex normally cannot seen without additional specialised electrodes
