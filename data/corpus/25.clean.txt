history
1872 alexander muirhead reported attached wires wrist patient fever obtain electronic record heartbeat
1882 john burdon sanderson working frogs first appreciate interval variations potential electrically quiescent coined term isoelectric interval period
1887 augustus waller invented ecg machine consisting lippmann capillary electrometer fixed projector
trace heartbeat projected onto photographic plate fixed toy train
allowed heartbeat recorded real time
1895 willem einthoven assigned letters p q r deflections theoretical waveform created using equations corrected actual waveform obtained capillary electrometer compensate imprecision instrument
using letters different b c letters used capillary electrometer 's waveform facilitated comparison uncorrected corrected lines drawn graph
einthoven probably chose initial letter p follow example set descartes geometry
precise waveform obtained using string galvanometer matched corrected capillary electrometer waveform continued use letters p q r letters still use today
einthoven also described electrocardiographic features number cardiovascular disorders
1897 string galvanometer invented french engineer cl ment ader
1901 einthoven working leiden netherlands used string galvanometer first practical ecg
device much sensitive capillary electrometer waller used
1924 einthoven awarded nobel prize medicine pioneering work developing ecg
1927 general electric developed portable apparatus could produce electrocardiograms without use string galvanometer
device instead combined amplifier tubes similar used radio internal lamp moving mirror directed tracing electric pulses onto film
1937 taro takemi invented new portable electrocardiograph machine
1942 emanuel goldberger increases voltage wilson 's unipolar leads 50 creates augmented limb leads avr avl avf
added einthoven 's three limb leads six chest leads arrive 12 lead electrocardiogram used today
late 1940s rune elmqvist invented inkjet printer thin jets ink deflected electrical potentials heart good frequency response direct recording ecg paper device called mingograf sold siemens elema 1990s
