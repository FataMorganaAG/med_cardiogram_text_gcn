The electrodes that form these signals are located on the limbs â€“ one on each arm and one on the left leg
Lead II is the voltage between the (positive) left leg (LL) electrode and the right arm (RA) electrode: II = LL - RA
The limb leads and augmented limb leads (Wilson's central terminal is used as the negative pole for the latter in this representation)
Lead I is the voltage between the (positive) left arm (LA) electrode and right arm (RA) electrode: I = LA - RA
The limb leads form the points of what is known as Einthoven's triangle
Lead III is the voltage between the (positive) left leg (LL) electrode and the left arm (LA) electrode: III = LL - LA
Leads I, II and III are called the limb leads
