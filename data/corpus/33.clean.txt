equilateral triangle einthoven formed leads ii iii
three standard leads arbitrarily established lead right arm negative left arm positive lead ii right arm negative left leg positive lead iii left arm negative left leg positive
polarities transported onto einthoven triangle
perpendicular center triangle divides lead axis two parts positive turned positive limb negative turned negative limb
single vector called cardiac vector magnitude direction sense represents depolarization repolarization
vector projections fall positive half lead axis appear positive deflections lead ecg negative half negative deflection
vector force parallel given lead axis project large deflection lead vector perpendicular lead axis project small biphasic complex lead
