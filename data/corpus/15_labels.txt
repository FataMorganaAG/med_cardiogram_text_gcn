For example, depolarizing from right to left would produce a positive deflection in lead I because the two vectors point in the same direction
The U wave is not typically seen and its absence is generally ignored
Interpretation of the ECG is ultimately that of pattern recognition
The P wave represents atrial depolarization
Atrial repolarisation is typically hidden in the much more prominent QRS complex and normally cannot be seen without additional, specialised electrodes
The theory is rooted in electromagnetics and boils down to the four following points: depolarization of the heart towards the positive electrode produces a positive deflection, depolarization of the heart away from the positive electrode produces a negative deflection, repolarization of the heart towards the positive electrode produces a negative deflection, repolarization of the heart away from the positive electrode produces a positive deflection
Schematic representation of a normal ECG
In order to understand the patterns found, it is helpful to understand the theory of what ECGs represent
The U wave represents papillary muscle repolarization
Normal rhythm produces four entities – a P wave, a QRS complex, a T wave, and a U wave – that each have a fairly unique pattern
Changes in the structure of the heart and its surroundings (including blood composition) change the patterns of these four entities
Thus, the overall direction of depolarization and repolarization produces positive or negative deflection on each lead's trace
In contrast, that same depolarization would produce minimal deflection in V1 and V2 because the vectors are perpendicular, and this phenomenon is called isoelectric
The T wave represents ventricular repolarization
The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization
