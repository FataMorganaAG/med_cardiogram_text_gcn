electrodes leads
electrodes actual conductive pads attached body surface
pair electrodes measure electrical potential difference two corresponding locations attachment
pair forms lead
however leads also formed physical electrode virtual electrode known wilson 's central terminal wct whose potential defined average potential measured three limb electrodes attached right arm left arm left foot respectively
commonly 10 electrodes attached body used form 12 ecg leads lead measuring specific electrical potential difference listed table
leads broken three types limb augmented limb precordial chest
12 lead ecg total three limb leads three augmented limb leads arranged like spokes wheel coronal plane vertical six precordial leads chest leads lie perpendicular transverse plane horizontal
medical settings term leads also sometimes used refer electrodes although technically incorrect
10 electrodes 12 lead ecg listed
electrode name electrode placement ra right arm avoiding thick muscle
la location ra placed left arm
rl right leg lower end inner aspect calf muscle avoid bony prominences
location rl placed left leg
v1 fourth intercostal space ribs 4 5 right sternum breastbone
v2 fourth intercostal space ribs 4 5 left sternum
v3 leads v2 v4
v4 fifth intercostal space ribs 5 6 mid clavicular line
v5 horizontally even v4 left anterior axillary line
v6 horizontally even v4 v5 mid axillary line
two types electrodes common use flat paper thin sticker self adhesive circular pad
former typically used single ecg recording latter continuous recordings stick longer
electrode consists electrically conductive electrolyte gel silver silver chloride conductor
gel typically contains potassium chloride sometimes silver chloride well permit electron conduction skin wire electrocardiogram
common virtual electrode known wilson 's central terminal vw produced averaging measurements electrodes ra la give average potential body 12 lead ecg leads except limb leads assumed unipolar avr avl avf v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6
measurement voltage requires two contacts electrically unipolar leads measured common lead negative unipolar lead positive
averaging common lead abstract unipolar lead concept makes challenging understanding complicated sloppy usage lead electrode
fact instead constant reference vw value fluctuates throughout heart cycle
also truly represent center heart potential due body parts signals travel
