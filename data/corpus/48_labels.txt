Determination of the Cardiac Rhythm Pacemaker Site.
The P waves configuration is equal in each lead.
The P wave duration indicates time of atria activation, the P – Q interval and the QRS complex duration – ventricular activation.
Interpretation of the ECG.
In the ECG conclusion it is necessary to note following: The cardiac rhythm pacemaker (sinus or nonsinus rhythm); Regularity of the cardiac rhythm (regular or irregular); The heart rate; Position of the electrical axis of the heart;  Presence of the four ECG syndromes: arrhythmias, abnormalities of conductivity, atrial and ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial damage (ischemia, injury, necrosis, scar).
If the amplitude of the highest R wave does not exceed 5 mm, or the sum of the R waves amplitude in the three standard leads is less than 15 mm the ECG voltage is considered decreased.
Measurement of the duration and amplitude of the ECG waves and intervals.
The R waves amplitude are measured in standard leads.
Measurement of the ECG Amplitude.
The R-R intervals in regular rhythm should be equal.
The normal sinus rhythm is characterized by upright P wave in lead I, II, aVF following by QRS complex.
Determination of the Cardiac Rhythm Regularity.
Its fluctuation normally does not exceed 0.1 second.
Determination of the Electrical Axis of the Heart.
Estimation of the Conductivity.
In regular cardiac rhythm the heart rate is determined by formula: HR = 60/R-R; where 60 is a number of seconds in minute, R-R – duration of the R-R intervals in seconds.
The depolarization and repolarization portions on the normal ECG.
Calculation of the Heart Rate.
Increased duration of these waves and intervals indicates slowed impulse conduction in corresponding part of the cardiac conduction system.
ECG conclusion.
Greater variations in the R-R intervals duration indicate irregular cardiac rhythm.
