limb leads electrical conduction heart
animation shown right illustrates path electrical conduction gives rise ecg waves limb leads
recall positive current created depolarization cardiac cells traveling towards positive electrode away negative electrode creates positive deflection ecg
likewise positive current traveling away positive electrode towards negative electrode creates negative deflection ecg
red arrow represents overall direction travel depolarization
magnitude red arrow proportional amount tissue depolarized instance
red arrow simultaneously shown axis 3 limb leads
direction magnitude red arrow 's projection onto axis limb lead shown blue arrows
direction magnitude blue arrows theoretically determine deflections ecg
example blue arrow axis lead moves negative electrode right towards positive electrode ecg line rises creating upward wave
blue arrow axis lead moves left downward wave created
greater magnitude blue arrow greater deflection ecg particular limb lead
frames 1 3 depict depolarization generated spreading sinoatrial node
sa node small depolarization detected ecgs
frames 4 10 depict depolarization traveling atria towards atrioventricular node
frame 7 depolarization traveling largest amount tissue atria creates highest point p wave
frames 11 12 depict depolarization traveling av node
like sa node av node small depolarization tissue detected ecgs
creates flat pr segment
frame 13 depicts interesting phenomenon simplified fashion
depicts depolarization starts travel interventricular septum bundle bundle branches
bundle conduction system splits left bundle branch right bundle branch
branches conduct action potentials 1
interestingly however action potential starts traveling left bundle branch 5 milliseconds starts traveling right bundle branch depicted frame 13
causes depolarization interventricular septum tissue spread left right depicted red arrow frame 14
cases gives rise negative deflection pr interval creating q wave one seen lead animation right
depending mean electrical axis heart phenomenon result q wave lead ii well
following depolarization interventricular septum depolarization travels towards apex heart
depicted frames 15 17 results positive deflection three limb leads creates r wave
frames 18 21 depict depolarization travels throughout ventricles apex heart following action potential purkinje fibers
phenomenon creates negative deflection three limb leads forming wave ecg
repolarization atria occurs time generation qrs complex detected ecg since tissue mass ventricles much larger atria
ventricular contraction occurs ventricular depolarization repolarization
time movement charge deflection created ecg
results flat st segment wave
frames 24 28 animation depict repolarization ventricles
epicardium first layer ventricles repolarize followed myocardium
endocardium last layer repolarize
plateau phase depolarization shown last longer endocardial cells epicardial cells
causes repolarization start apex heart move upwards
since repolarization spread negative current membrane potentials decrease back resting membrane potential red arrow animation pointing direction opposite repolarization
therefore creates positive deflection ecg creates wave
