electrocardiographs popular fluctuations recorded moving paper measurement
operating principle
fluctuations potential difference arise exitation heart muscle senced electrodes attached patient body transmitted apparatus
input voltage extremely low therefore amplified 600 700 times
tape may move various speeds 25 100 mm speed 50 mm usually preferred
dark paper coated heart sensitive layers paraffin chalk hot stylus removes paraffin colored supporting paper record
ink writing instruments draw curves paper
speed tape known easy calculate duration separate elements ecg
recording principle differs various instruments
since magnitude direction electromotive force incessantly change cardiac cycle galvanometer pointer shows variations voltage recording device draws curve moving paper show graphically fluctuations
sensitivity amplification apparatus checked recording electrocardiograms
end standardization voltage 1 mv used caused 1 cm deviation stylus
whichever instrument used sensitivity galvanometer selected voltage 1 mv causes 1 cm deviation recording device
electrocardiographs special heart sensitive paper used
waves amplitude measured mm duration seconds
