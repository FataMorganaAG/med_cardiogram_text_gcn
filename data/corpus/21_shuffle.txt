endocardium last layer repolarize
time movement charge deflection created ecg
repolarization atria occurs time generation qrs complex detected ecg since tissue mass ventricles much larger atria
causes depolarization interventricular septum tissue spread left right depicted red arrow frame 14

frames 18 21 depict depolarization travels throughout ventricles apex heart following action potential purkinje fibers
recall positive current created depolarization cardiac cells traveling towards positive electrode away negative electrode creates positive deflection ecg

epicardium first layer ventricles repolarize followed myocardium
causes repolarization start apex heart move upwards
