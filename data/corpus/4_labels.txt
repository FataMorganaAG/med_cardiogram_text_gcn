Many ECG machines are now portable and commonly include a screen, keyboard, and printer on a small wheeled cart.
This low voltage necessitates a low noise circuit, instrumentation amplifiers, and electromagnetic shielding.
Electrostatic discharge is similar to defibrillation discharge and requires voltage protection up to 18,000 volts.
This analysis calculates features such as the PR interval, QT interval, corrected QT (QTc) interval, PR axis, QRS axis, rhythm and more.
The results from these automated algorithms are considered "preliminary" until verified and/or modified by expert interpretation.
Other features include: Defibrillation protection: any ECG used in healthcare may be attached to a person who requires defibrillation and the ECG needs to protect itself from this source of energy.
Additionally, circuitry called the right leg driver can be used to reduce common-mode interference (typically the 50 or 60 Hz mains power).
Electrocardiograph machines.
Early ECG machines were constructed with analog electronics, where the signal drove a motor to print out the signal onto paper.
Today, electrocardiographs use analog-to-digital converters to convert the electrical activity of the heart to a digital signal.
Most modern ECG machines include automated interpretation algorithms.
Recent advancements in electrocardiography include developing even smaller devices for inclusion in fitness trackers and smart watches.
The machines are powered by mains power but they are designed with several safety features including an earthed (ground) lead.
Despite recent advances, computer misinterpretation remains a significant problem and can result in clinical mismanagement.
Recording an ECG is a safe and painless procedure.
Electrocardiograms are recorded by machines that consist of a set of electrodes connected to a central unit.
These smaller devices often rely on only two electrodes to deliver a single lead I.
Portable six-lead devices are also available.
ECG voltages measured across the body are very small.
Simultaneous lead recordings: earlier designs recorded each lead sequentially, but current models record multiple leads simultaneously.
