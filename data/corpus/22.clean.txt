ischemia infarction
ischemia non st elevation myocardial infarctions non stemis may manifest st depression inversion waves
may also affect high frequency band qrs
st elevation myocardial infarctions stemis different characteristic ecg findings based amount time elapsed since mi first occurred
earliest sign hyperacute waves peaked waves due local hyperkalemia ischemic myocardium
progresses period minutes elevations st segment least 1 mm
period hours pathologic q wave may appear wave invert
period days st elevation resolve
pathologic q waves generally remain permanently
coronary artery occluded identified stemi based location st elevation
left anterior descending lad artery supplies anterior wall heart therefore causes st elevations anterior leads v1 v2
lcx supplies lateral aspect heart therefore causes st elevations lateral leads avl v6
right coronary artery rca usually supplies inferior aspect heart therefore causes st elevations inferior leads ii iii avf
