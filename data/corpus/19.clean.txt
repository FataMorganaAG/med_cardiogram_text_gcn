axis
heart several axes common far axis qrs complex references axis imply qrs axis
axis computationally determined result number representing degrees deviation zero categorized types
qrs axis general direction ventricular depolarization wavefront mean electrical vector frontal plane
often sufficient classify axis one three types normal left deviated right deviated
population data shows normal qrs axis 30 105 0 along lead positive inferior negative superior best understood graphically hexaxial reference system
beyond 105 right axis deviation beyond 30 left axis deviation third quadrant 90 180 rare indeterminate axis
shortcut determining qrs axis normal qrs complex mostly positive lead lead ii lead avf 90 upper limit normal
normal qrs axis generally left following anatomical orientation heart within chest
abnormal axis suggests change physical shape orientation heart defect conduction system causes ventricles depolarize abnormal way
classification angle notes
normal 30 105 normal
left axis deviation 30 90 may indicate left ventricular hypertrophy left anterior fascicular block old inferior stemi
right axis deviation 105 180 may indicate right ventricular hypertrophy left posterior fascicular block old lateral stemi
indeterminate axis 180 90 rarely seen considered 'electrical man 's land'
extent normal axis 90 105 depending source
