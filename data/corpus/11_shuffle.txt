addition two precordial leads next one another considered contiguous
lateral leads avl v5 v6 look electrical activity vantage point lateral wall left ventricle
anterior leads v3 v4 look electrical activity vantage point anterior wall right left ventricles sternocostal surface heart
diagram showing contiguous leads color standard 12 lead layout
inferior leads leads ii iii avf look electrical activity vantage point inferior surface diaphragmatic surface heart
septal leads v1 v2 look electrical activity vantage point septal surface heart interventricular septum
example though v4 anterior lead v5 lateral lead contiguous next one another
contiguity leads
category leads activity
12 ecg leads records electrical activity heart different angle therefore align different anatomical areas heart
two leads look neighboring anatomical areas said contiguous
