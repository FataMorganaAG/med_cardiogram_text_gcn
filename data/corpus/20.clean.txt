amplitudes intervals
waves ecg tracing intervals predictable time duration range acceptable amplitudes voltages typical morphology
deviation normal tracing potentially pathological therefore clinical significance
ease measuring amplitudes intervals ecg printed graph paper standard scale 1 mm one small box standard ecg paper represents 40 milliseconds time x axis 0 1 millivolts axis
p wave p wave represents depolarization atria
atrial depolarization spreads sa node towards av node right atrium left atrium
p wave typically upright leads except avr unusual p wave axis inverted leads indicate ectopic atrial pacemaker
p wave unusually long duration may represent atrial enlargement
typically large right atrium gives tall peaked p wave large left atrium gives two humped bifid p wave 80 ms
pr interval pr interval measured beginning p wave beginning qrs complex
interval reflects time electrical impulse takes travel sinus node av node
pr interval shorter 120 ms suggests electrical impulse bypassing av node wolf parkinson white syndrome
pr interval consistently longer 200 ms diagnoses first degree atrioventricular block
pr segment portion tracing p wave qrs complex typically completely flat may depressed pericarditis 120 200 ms
qrs complex qrs complex represents rapid depolarization right left ventricles
ventricles large muscle mass compared atria qrs complex usually much larger amplitude p wave
qrs complex wide longer 120 ms suggests disruption heart 's conduction system lbbb rbbb ventricular rhythms ventricular tachycardia
metabolic issues severe hyperkalemia tricyclic antidepressant overdose also widen qrs complex
unusually tall qrs complex may represent left ventricular hypertrophy low amplitude qrs complex may represent pericardial effusion infiltrative myocardial disease 80 100 ms
j point j point point qrs complex finishes st segment begins
j point may elevated normal variant
appearance separate j wave osborn wave j point pathognomonic hypothermia hypercalcemia
st segment st segment connects qrs complex wave represents period ventricles depolarized
usually isoelectric may depressed elevated myocardial infarction ischemia
st depression also caused lvh digoxin
st elevation also caused pericarditis brugada syndrome normal variant j point elevation
wave wave represents repolarization ventricles
generally upright leads except avr lead v1
inverted waves sign myocardial ischemia left ventricular hypertrophy high intracranial pressure metabolic abnormalities
peaked waves sign hyperkalemia early myocardial infarction 160 ms
corrected qt interval qtc qt interval measured beginning qrs complex end wave
acceptable ranges vary heart rate must corrected qtc dividing square root rr interval
prolonged qtc interval risk factor ventricular tachyarrhythmias sudden death
long qt arise genetic syndrome side effect certain medications
unusually short qtc seen severe hypercalcemia 440 ms
u wave u wave hypothesized caused repolarization interventricular septum
normally low amplitude even often completely absent
prominent u wave sign hypokalemia hypercalcemia hyperthyroidism
