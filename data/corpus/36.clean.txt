electrical axis heart
electrical axis heart coincides anatomical axis lies interventricular septum
einthoven triangle hexaxial reference system useful determining electrical axis heart
basic principle electrical force parallel given lead axis record largest deflection ecg lead electrical force perpendicular lead axis record small complex ecg lead
cardiac vector directed toward positive pole lead axis deflections positive given lead cardiac vector directed toward negative pole lead axis deflections negative given lead
electrical axis heart determined shape ventricular complexes standard leads
relation electrical axis magnitude qrs complexes standard leads described einthoven triangle
