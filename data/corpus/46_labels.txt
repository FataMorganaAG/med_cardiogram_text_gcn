For example, at the rate of 60 – 80 beats per minute, Q – T duration is 0.32 – 0.37 second in men, and 0.35 – 0.4 in women.
Its duration depends on the heart rate.
Its duration depends on the cardiac rate.
The Q – T interval in women is longer than in man.
Q – T interval (QRST complex), measured from the beginning of the Q (or R) wave to the end of the T wave, represents electrical ventricular systole.
Q – T interval, P interval.
P interval, measured from the end of the T wave to the beginning of the P wave, represents electrical diastole of the heart.
