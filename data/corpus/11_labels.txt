Diagram showing the contiguous leads in the same color in the standard 12-lead layout
Contiguity of leads
Lateral leads	I, aVL, V5 and V6	Look at the electrical activity from the vantage point of the lateral wall of left ventricle
Two leads that look at neighboring anatomical areas are said to be contiguous
Each of the 12 ECG leads records the electrical activity of the heart from a different angle, and therefore align with different anatomical areas of the heart
For example, though V4 is an anterior lead and V5 is a lateral lead, they are contiguous because they are next to one another
Anterior leads	V3 and V4	Look at electrical activity from the vantage point of the anterior wall of the right and left ventricles (Sternocostal surface of heart)
In addition, any two precordial leads next to one another are considered to be contiguous
Septal leads	V1 and V2	Look at electrical activity from the vantage point of the septal surface of the heart (interventricular septum)
Inferior leads	Leads II, III and aVF	Look at electrical activity from the vantage point of the inferior surface (diaphragmatic surface of heart)
