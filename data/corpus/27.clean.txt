operating principle
fluctuations potential difference arise exitation heart muscle senced electrodes attached patient body transmitted apparatus
input voltage extremely low therefore amplified 600 700 times
since magnitude direction electromotive force incessantly change cardiac cycle galvanometer pointer shows variations voltage recording device draws curve moving paper show graphically fluctuations
recording principle differs various instruments
electrocardiographs popular fluctuations recorded moving paper measurement
ink writing instruments draw curves paper
electrocardiographs special heart sensitive paper used
dark paper coated heart sensitive layers paraffin chalk hot stylus removes paraffin colored supporting paper record
