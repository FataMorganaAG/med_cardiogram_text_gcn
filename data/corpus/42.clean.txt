wave
wave formation ecg reflects depolarization basal parts interventricular septum right left ventricles
normal wave inverted amplitude different electrocardiographic lead within large ranges exceed 20 mm 2 5 mm average
limb lids wave amplitude low except avr lead normal position heart chest
chest leads wave amplitude decreases v1 v2 v4 v5 v6 leads wave amplitude low wave may even absent
equal wave r wave amplitude chest leads usually v3 transition zone rarer v2 v3 v3 v4
