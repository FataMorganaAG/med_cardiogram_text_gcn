p wave represents atrial depolarization
changes structure heart surroundings including blood composition change patterns four entities
interpretation ecg ultimately pattern recognition
qrs complex represents ventricular depolarization
atrial repolarisation typically hidden much prominent qrs complex normally cannot seen without additional specialised electrodes
contrast depolarization would produce minimal deflection v1 v2 vectors perpendicular phenomenon called isoelectric
thus overall direction depolarization repolarization produces positive negative deflection lead 's trace
u wave typically seen absence generally ignored
theory rooted electromagnetics boils four following points depolarization heart towards positive electrode produces positive deflection depolarization heart away positive electrode produces negative deflection repolarization heart towards positive electrode produces negative deflection repolarization heart away positive electrode produces positive deflection

wave represents ventricular repolarization
example depolarizing right left would produce positive deflection lead two vectors point direction
normal rhythm produces four entities p wave qrs complex wave u wave fairly unique pattern
u wave represents papillary muscle repolarization
