electrical systole diastole normal ecg
cardiac cycle two electrical processes depolarization repolarization
depolarization electrochemical phenomenon occurs rapidly
repolarization electrochemical phenomenon energy restoration occurs slowly
therefore qrs complex ventricular depolarization short duration wave ventricular repolarization long duration
