specialized leads
additional electrodes may rarely placed generate leads specific diagnostic purposes
right sided precordial leads may used better study pathology right ventricle dextrocardia denoted r e g v5r
posterior leads v7 v9 may used demonstrate presence posterior myocardial infarction
lewis lead requiring electrode right sternal border second intercostal space used study pathological rhythms arising right atrium
esophogeal lead inserted part esophagus distance posterior wall left atrium approximately 5 6 mm remaining constant people different age weight
esophageal lead avails accurate differentiation certain cardiac arrhythmias particularly atrial flutter av nodal reentrant tachycardia orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia
also evaluate risk people wolff parkinson white syndrome well terminate supraventricular tachycardia caused entry
intracardiac electrogram iceg essentially ecg added intracardiac leads inside heart
standard ecg leads external leads ii iii avl v1 v6
two four intracardiac leads added via cardiac catheterization
word electrogram egm without specification usually means intracardiac electrogram
