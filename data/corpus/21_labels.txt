This therefore creates a positive deflection in the ECG, and creates the T wave
This results in the flat ST segment after the S wave
The epicardium is the first layer of the ventricles to repolarize, followed by the myocardium
The animation shown to the right illustrates how the path of electrical conduction gives rise to the ECG waves in the limb leads
This phenomenon creates a negative deflection in all three limb leads, forming the S wave on the ECG
The SA node is too small for its depolarization to be detected on most ECGs
Frames 1–3 depict the depolarization being generated in and spreading through the Sinoatrial node
Repolarization of the atria occurs at the same time as the generation of the QRS complex, but it is not detected by the ECG since the tissue mass of the ventricles is so much larger than that of the atria
This causes the depolarization of the interventricular septum tissue to spread from left to right, as depicted by the red arrow in frame 14
During frame 7, the depolarization is traveling through the largest amount of tissue in the atria, which creates the highest point in the P wave
This creates the flat PR segment
This causes repolarization to start from the apex of the heart and move upwards
For example, as a blue arrow on the axis for Lead I moves from the negative electrode, to the right, towards the positive electrode, the ECG line rises, creating an upward wave
The red arrow represents the overall direction of travel of the depolarization
Both branches conduct action potentials at about 1 m/s
During this time, there is no movement of charge, so no deflection is created on the ECG
Frames 24–28 in the animation depict repolarization of the ventricles
Frames 18–21 then depict the depolarization as it travels throughout both ventricles from the apex of the heart, following the action potential in the Purkinje fibers
Then, the direction and magnitude of the blue arrows are what theoretically determine the deflections on the ECG
Following depolarization of the interventricular septum, the depolarization travels towards the apex of the heart
Ventricular contraction occurs between ventricular depolarization and repolarization
It depicts the depolarization as it starts to travel down the interventricular septum, through the Bundle of His and Bundle branches
The plateau phase of depolarization has been shown to last longer in endocardial cells than in epicardial cells
In some cases, this gives rise to a negative deflection after the PR interval, creating a Q wave such as the one seen in lead I in the animation to the right
Recall that a positive current (as created by depolarization of cardiac cells) traveling towards the positive electrode and away from the negative electrode creates a positive deflection on the ECG
Since repolarization is the spread of negative current as membrane potentials decrease back down to the resting membrane potential, the red arrow in the animation is pointing in the direction opposite of the repolarization
Frames 4–10 depict the depolarization traveling through the atria, towards the Atrioventricular node
The magnitude of the red arrow is proportional to the amount of tissue being depolarized at that instance
The red arrow is simultaneously shown on the axis of each of the 3 limb leads
Interestingly, however, the action potential starts traveling down the left bundle branch about 5 milliseconds before it starts traveling down the right bundle branch, as depicted by frame 13
As the blue arrow on the axis for Lead I moves to the left, a downward wave is created
The greater the magnitude of the blue arrow, the greater the deflection on the ECG for that particular limb lead
The endocardium is the last layer to repolarize
After the Bundle of His, the conduction system splits into the left bundle branch and the right bundle branch
Like the SA node, the AV node is too small for the depolarization of its tissue to be detected on most ECGs
This is depicted by frames 15–17 and results in a positive deflection on all three limb leads, which creates the R wave
Likewise, a positive current traveling away from the positive electrode and towards the negative electrode creates a negative deflection on the ECG
Frame 13 depicts an interesting phenomenon in an over-simplified fashion
Depending on the mean electrical axis of the heart, this phenomenon can result in a Q wave in lead II as well
Both the direction and the magnitude of the red arrow's projection onto the axis of each limb lead is shown with blue arrows
Frames 11–12 depict the depolarization traveling through the AV node
