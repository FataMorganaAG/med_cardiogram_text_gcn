depolarization electrochemical phenomenon occurs rapidly
cardiac cycle two electrical processes depolarization repolarization
repolarization electrochemical phenomenon energy restoration occurs slowly
electrical systole diastole normal ecg
therefore qrs complex ventricular depolarization short duration wave ventricular repolarization long duration
