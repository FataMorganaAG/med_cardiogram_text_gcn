Operating principle
These are ink-writing instruments, which draw curves on paper
The input voltage is extremely low, and it is therefore amplified 600 – 700 times
The recording principle differs with various instruments
There are electrocardiographs in which special heart-sensitive paper is used
Since the magnitude and direction of the electromotive force incessantly change during the cardiac cycle, the galvanometer pointer shows variations in the voltage a recording device draws a curve on a moving paper to show graphically these fluctuations
Fluctuations in the potential difference that arise during the exitation of the heart muscle are senced by the electrodes attached to the patient’s body and transmitted to the apparatus
Dark paper is coated with heart- sensitive layers of paraffin and chalk; a hot stylus, which removes paraffin from the colored supporting paper, does the record
Electrocardiographs are popular in which the fluctuations are recorded on a moving paper during the measurement
