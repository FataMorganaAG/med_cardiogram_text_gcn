u wave represents papillary muscle repolarization
qrs complex represents ventricular depolarization
normal rhythm produces four entities p wave qrs complex wave u wave fairly unique pattern
order understand patterns found helpful understand theory ecgs represent
schematic representation normal ecg
thus overall direction depolarization repolarization produces positive negative deflection lead 's trace
wave represents ventricular repolarization
interpretation ecg ultimately pattern recognition
atrial repolarisation typically hidden much prominent qrs complex normally cannot seen without additional specialised electrodes
example depolarizing right left would produce positive deflection lead two vectors point direction
changes structure heart surroundings including blood composition change patterns four entities
contrast depolarization would produce minimal deflection v1 v2 vectors perpendicular phenomenon called isoelectric
theory rooted electromagnetics boils four following points depolarization heart towards positive electrode produces positive deflection depolarization heart away positive electrode produces negative deflection repolarization heart towards positive electrode produces negative deflection repolarization heart away positive electrode produces positive deflection
p wave represents atrial depolarization
u wave typically seen absence generally ignored
