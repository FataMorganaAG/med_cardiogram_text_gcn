The normal T wave is asymmetric: the gradual ascent converts into a rounded summit, which is followed by abrupt descent.
T wave.
The normal T wave duration is 0.12 – 0.16 second, amplitude – 2.5 – 6 mm.
The normal T wave is always inverted in aVR lead.
The normal T wave is always upright in I, II, aVF, V2 – V6, TI > TIII, and TV6 > TV1 leads.
T wave may be upright, two-phased or inverted in III, aVL and V1 leads.
T wave represents repolarization of both ventricles.
