proposed exclude electrode connection electrode extremity explored
three augmented unipolar leads distinguished avr augmented unipolar right arm lead central terminal connection right arm left leg electrodes avl augmented unipolar left arm lead central terminal connection right arm left leg electrodes avf augmented unipolar left leg lead central terminal connection right arm left arm electrodes
goldberger proposition unipolar limb leads wilson taken exploring electrode connected designated extremity right arm left arm left leg indifferent electrode central terminal connected three limbs including extremity explored
coldberger modified augmented wilson extremity lead increasing amplitude deflections 50
observed final deflections obtained wilson central terminal system limb leads generally low voltage making interpretation difficult
electrode placement standard leads technique
augmented unipolar limb leads
goldberger proposed augmented unipolar leads 1942 year
letter used designate augmented lead
