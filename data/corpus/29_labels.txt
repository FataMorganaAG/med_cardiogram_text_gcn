The ECG leads
Lead III is obtained by connecting the left arm (-) and left leg (+) electrodes
To record a routine ECG, 12 leads are used in clinical practice: 3 standard bipolar limb leads, 3 augmented unipolar limb leads, 6 chest leads
Lead II is obtained by connecting the right arm (-) and left leg (+) electrodes
Standard leads proposed by Einthoven in 1913 y., record potential difference between two points of the body
Lead I is obtained by connecting the right arm (-) and left arm (+) electrodes
Standard Bipolar Limb Leads
The electrodes are placed on the right arm, the left arm, the left leg, and the fourth electrode on the right leg is connected with the earth wire
