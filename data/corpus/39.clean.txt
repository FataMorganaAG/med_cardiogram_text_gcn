normal electrocardiogram sinus rhythm
electrical activation heart initiated sa node however cause electrical deflection surface ecg
p wave first upward deflection graphic representation electrical activation atria
impulse first cause excitation right atrium left atrium ascending portion p wave reflects depolarization right atrium descending portion reflects depolarization left atrium
normal p wave formation
normal p wave duration 0 8 0 10 second amplitude 1 2 mm
normal p wave upright ii avf v2 v6 leads
p wave may upright two phased iii avl v1 leads sometimes even inverted iii avl leads
p wave always inverted avr lead
