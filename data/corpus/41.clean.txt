r wave
r wave represents process depolarization ventricles
normal r wave amplitude 5 15 mm
normal r wave recorded standard augmented limb leads
avr lead r wave may low even absent
chest leads r wave amplitude increases v1 v4 slightly decreases v5 v6 leads
rv1 v2 reflects activation interventricular septum r wave v4 v5 v6 leads activation right left ventricles
